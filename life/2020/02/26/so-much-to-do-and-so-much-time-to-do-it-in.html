Classes are over, and it’s only a few sporadic tests or assignment submissions here and there to occupy my time. I got a PPO (pre-placement offer) from a great organisation, so I am totally ready-to-go in that respect. This means that most of my time, and I mean entire days on end are completely free. Which should be such a great thing!</p> <p>Except that it’s not. It is really really not. I often find myself procrastinating. And even more often, just simply wasting time. It depends on the kind of mindset I am in at the moment. I spend hours on end watching YouTube videos. It’s true that I stay away from inane garbage, but even just sticking to technology/automotive videos and educational content leaves me open to a vast library. I believe it enhances my knowledge, and I have often found myself able to better explain myself, or join a conversation, or help someone, just because I watched some video which gave me some tiny bit of information. But is it really productive in the larger scheme of things? This is what I meant when I said it depends on my mindset at a given moment, how I view this time spent.</p> <p>It might seem really picayune to some, but to me it is really not. Increasingly, I find myself trying to tear my attention away from the video I am watching, or trying to prevent my fingers from typing out ‘youtube’ in the browser’s address bar. I’ve gotten so used to it that whenever I open up my laptop, I somehow automatically end up staring at the YouTube homepage!</p> <p>So, to sum it all up, I’ve concluded that it is not the best use of my time just ‘watching’ endlessly, not ‘doing’ anything of my own.</p> <p>However, this also led me on to a bigger realisation. And it’s not the first time I’ve had this realisation, it ‘comes and goes’, as they say. Anyway, the realisation is this - the human mind is made to be occupied. It is meant to be working on something. Taking a break, relaxing, travelling, all that is okay, but in the end, if our brains are twiddling their thumbs on a regular, everyday basis, then that just doesn’t work. It becomes difficult to apply oneself after such a hiatus from any constructive thought. And it’s also true that while time is spend on thinking nothing, you are equally prone to negative thought. I am currently in the middle of a massive family issue concerning myself very deeply and I often find myself falling into this destructive pattern where I keep thinking of it, even when I know there is nothing but time that will solve the issue and my thinking about it is not going to accomplish anything!</p> <p>As Satchmo says, it is often in life that we find ourselves wishing we had more time. I can attest to that because that has been the state of affairs for me for the past 24 years of my life. And it hurts knowing we could have accomplished more if only our day was an hour longer. But, on the other hand, it is equally hard to sit around doing nothing. In my opinion, it is even worse!</p> <p>I set a goal for myself today - to spend time doing anything other than consuming content. The world we live in today gives us so many avenues to just consume content rather than doing something of our own. But I need to make a conscious effort to not give in to the urge of doing the easy thing - watching videos. Truthfully speaking, there is so much more I could be doing. Maybe an online course to enhance my knowledge and skills. Maybe being more regular with this blog. Maybe pursuing one of my other interests - art, music, gaming, anything! And maybe even taking that solo trip that I’ve been longing to do for years now!</p> <p>It is a gift - to have time to devote to whatever you want. I plan to start using the gift that I’ve been given, starting now.</p> </div> <nav class="page-pagination" role="navigation"> <a class="page-previous" href="/blogging/code/2020/02/21/it-s-done.html"> <h4 class="page-pagination-label">Previous</h4> <span class="page-pagination-title"> <i class="fas fa-arrow-left"></i> It’s done! </span> </a> <a class="page-next" href="/life/2020/03/06/promises-promises.html"> <h4 class="page-pagination-label">Next</h4> <span class="page-pagination-title"> Promises Promises <i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i> </span> </a> </nav> </div> </div> </article> </main> <footer id="footer" class="site-footer"> <!-- start custom footer snippets --> <!-- end custom footer snippets --> <div class="social-icons"> <a class="social-icon" href="/atom.xml"><i class="fas fa-rss-square fa-2x" title="Feed"></i></a> </div> <div class="copyright"> Made with 💙 by <a href="https://divayprakash.github.io/">Divay Prakash</a> <br> Hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> and powered by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> &bull; Based on <a href="https://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/">So Simple Theme</a> by <a href="https://mademistakes.com/">Michael Rose</a> <br> Source code available on <a href="https://github.com/divayprakash/random-musings">Github</a> &bull; &copy; 2020 Divay Prakash </div> </footer> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js" integrity="sha256-FgpCb/KJQlLNfOu91ta32o/NMZxltwRo8QtmkMRdAu8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/main.min.js"></script> <script src="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.0.12/js/all.js"></script> <!-- MathJax --> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.2/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"></script> </body> </html>
